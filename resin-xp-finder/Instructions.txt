# ANYCUBIC RESIN EXPOSURE FINDER by X3msnake

---------------------------------------------

### PREPARATION ###

Download and unzip the 'resin-xp-finder' folder to your machine USB

### SETUP ###

- Make sure your machine is levelled before running the test
- Insert and fix the vat and build platform
- Load the vat with the resin you want to test

### ENABLE MACHINE TEST MODE ###

- Run 'test-mode.gcode' (one of the files in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder)

### EXPOSE YOUR RESIN ###

- Run 'resin-test-005.100.2.20.photon' (one of the files in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder)

### CLEAN AND CURE FILM ###

At the end of the test:
- Remove the build platform
- Rinse with the appropriate resin cleaning solvent (usually IPA), making sure excess resin is removed
- Cure the test film still attached to the build platform
- After curing gently peel off the film

### MAKING SENSE OF THE RESULTS ###
 
- To know what exposure time each column represents, just multiply the column number by 2 (col1 = 2sec, col2 = 4sec,... col10 = 20 sec)
- Resin underexposure: the small lines and details are missing 
- Resin minimum exposure: the first column were the cured graphics begin to show 
- Resin sweet spot: the first column where you can see most of the details (the one just before the negative spaces start to disappear)
- Resin overexposure: colunmns where the negative space starts to disapear

### RETURN YOUR MACHINE TO PRINT MODE ###

- Run 'print-mode.gcode' (one of the files in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder)

---------------------------------------------

That's it, dial in your new found exposure time on a test piece and enjoy the magic
