This resin test by Tycho Pandelaar was run with the old file version that exposed to the FEP

This poor job of a test was my own done with the old version that exposed to the FEP, made with anycubic green resin, was run with the base exposure and normal exposure at 2s

You can see that the minimum viable exposure for this resin (The first resin column to cure) is 2sx4 = 8s this is the setting i use for 2.5Âµ layers

The poor job in cleaning the resin excess makes it more less impossible to detect what are the other important settings :P

Kudos to @Reonarudo for finding what makes .photon files tick. Check his project to convert images into .photon files (here)[https://github.com/Reonarudo/pcb2photon]

Kudos to Toby1kanobi in the anycubic owners forum for translating and cleaning up the gcode file used to switch modes in the printer
