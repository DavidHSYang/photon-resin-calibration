# photon-resin-calibration

Anycubic Photon - Files and method to quickly find the best exposure settings for any resin or UV film

The exposure range (latitude) tester removes most of the guesswork on layer time exposure by using multiple consecutive exposures to simulate different unique layer times for each test colum. 

All this with the added bonus of learning all in one go, the minimum viable width for positive and negative space details of each column exposure time.

Kudos to @Reonarudo for finding what makes .photon files tick. Check his project to convert images into .photon files (here)[https://github.com/Reonarudo/pcb2photon]

Kudos to Toby1kanobi in the anycubic owners forum for translating and cleaning up the gcode file used to switch modes in the printer
