Anycubic Photon - Files and method to quickly find the best exposure settings for any resin or UV film

The exposure range (latitude) tester removes most of the guesswork on layer time exposure by using multiple consecutive exposures to simulate different unique layer times for each test colum. 

All this with the added bonus of learning all in one go, the minimum viable width for positive and negative space details of each column exposure time.

###QUICK READ OF A CARD
- Start from top and locate first well formed circle column
- Move to bottom last visible Circle
- Move right untill the circle starts to clog
- Backtrack one colum
- That's your sweetspot

Below is an example of validation models done from a 2-20s range card, revealing a usable range of 8-18s exposure time.

The origins of this test come from a silkcreen and darkroom tuning technique called step wedge test, read about it [> here <](https://web.archive.org/web/20190409185035/https://medium.com/@spotprintsonline/step-wedge-test-a-high-quality-print-requires-a-good-stencils-cb1fbaa11998)

Kudos to @Reonarudo for finding what makes .photon files tick. Check his project to convert images into .photon files (here)[https://github.com/Reonarudo/pcb2photon]

Kudos to Toby1kanobi in the anycubic owners forum for translating and cleaning up the gcode file used to switch modes in the printer
