This resin test by Tycho Pandelaar was run with the old file version that exposed to the FEP

This was test was my own, done with the old version that exposed to the FEP, made with anycubic green resin, was run with the base exposure and normal exposure at 2s, the poor job in cleaning the resin excess maked it more less impossible to detect other important features of the test :P

You can see that the minimum viable exposure for this resin (The first resin column to cure) is 2sx4 = 8s this is the setting i use for 2.5Âµ layers

Kudos to @Reonarudo for finding what makes .photon files tick. Check his project to convert images into .photon files (here)[https://github.com/Reonarudo/pcb2photon]

Kudos to Toby1kanobi in the anycubic owners forum for translating and cleaning up the gcode file used to switch modes in the printer
